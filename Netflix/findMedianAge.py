#The problems in this chapter are all related to content displaying functionality, and how it can be optimized - this is obviously a major goal for a 
#content-streaming service like Netflix. Primarily, weâ€™ll focus on problems related to the search and recommendation functionality.

#3: Find Median Age:
#Our third task is building a filter that will fetch relevant content based on the age of the users for a specific country or region.
#For this, we use the median age of users and the preferred content for users that fall into that specified category. Because the number
#of users is constantly increasing on the Netflix platform, we need to figure out a structure or design that updates the median age of
#users in real-time. We will have a list that constantly receives age values, and we will output the median value after each new data point.
